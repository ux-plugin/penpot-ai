//! The GPU production sink — executes a `crate::schedule::Schedule` on the Vello backend.
//!
//! render-core builds the neutral schedule (which surface each shape paints into, how surfaces
//! compose, in z-order). This sink is the backend half: it maps each logical `SurfaceRef` to a GPU
//! texture, runs each step, and presents the result on the swapchain.
//!
//! - `Paint` → render one node's body (via the `PAINT_ONLY`-scoped scene render) into the target
//!   surface; the first write to a surface clears, later writes `render_load` (so a tile's output
//!   accumulates many shapes + composited effect surfaces in z-order).
//! - `Composite` → a `SrcOver` blit ([`crate::vello::blend`]) of one surface into another (or the
//!   swapchain). The GPU clips the blit quad to the target, so an effect surface that overlaps
//!   several tiles composites the right slice into each.
//!
//! Each step submits on its own encoder — the same ordering discipline as the tile store's
//! submit-per-tile fix, and required here because a later `Paint` into a tile must observe an
//! earlier `Composite` into it.
